//------------------------Introduction-------------------------------------------
This Java application connects to voltdb using a localhost configuration to perfrom multicore programming tests on certain functions
The results are displayed as a line graph.

The flow of the application is to establish a connection to the desired database. Perform uniform testing on that database and then 
save that result into a test result graph.

The line graph is displayed as number of threads and execution time (seconds probably)

A requirement is that all the databases must be running before the test so the connection can be made. This may be provided already in the a script depending
if it exists.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//------------Java Application--------------------------------------
connector - Uses voltdb client to create a connection, do inserts, other procedures that can be defined in another class or defined in ddl.sql
main - runs benchmark applciation
thread - Uses voltdb client to make concurrent procedures such as inserts or reads.
deployment.xml - Cluster config file

//------------------------------------------------------------------

//--------How to Run-------------------------------------
type ./benchmark.sh

To see results type vim execTime.txt
//-------------------------------------------------------

//--------------------------Interupting the Results---------------------------
The tests return the number of threads and the time it took to insert those results.
