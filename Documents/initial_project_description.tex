  \section{Introduction}
  This project's goal is to create a database that utilizes advanced multiprocessor techniques and algorithms to fully utilize modern hardware.
  We will be utilizing the Tervel framework that was developed by Dr. Dechev and his lab that implements multiprocessor-friendly memory management
  as well as various lock-free and wait-free data structures. These data structures will permit us to handle many concurrent transactions without 
  waits or locks.
  
  \subsection{Motivations}
  \subsubsection{Michael McGee's Motivation}
  My motivation for choosing this project is simply a desire to learn. I have always been interested in database systems as well concurrent programming. Nowhere do these issues more converge than in the project that Dr. Dechev proposed.  
  I hope to gain from this project, a greater understanding of the underlying principles of database system design, as well as discover broader applications for lock-free and wait-free data structures. I know that throughout the course of this project I will learn a great deal and come out as a much improved software developer and computer scientist.
