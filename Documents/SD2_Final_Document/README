In order to build this document you need to download and unzip the "graphics.7z" file on the Google Drive.

Instructions on how to do that:
	- Download the archive from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9j_rdidll-JQlA1N3BMUEYzbkk/view?usp=sharing
	- Unzip it using the p7zip tool into a directory called "graphics"
	- All done!

I also commented out a line because it was giving me a ton of errors.

These changes are in lines:
