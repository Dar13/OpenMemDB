talk to the professor about building databases
cite thread management for thread pool
tervel stores data so it will be used in database, transition manager and work manager
hard to find a open source options for components, ask professor for references
tervel metric for thread announcement in github tervel, other stuff
makeFile for tervel only
testing is done on python and not on bash for tervel (recent change)
Tervel testing may or may not be used for other things outside of the database/transition manager component
be careful of tervel API and other APIs
