Read papers on data structures on  tervel.

Use:
	-Skip list
	-Priority queue / multi dimensinal list

Approach 1:
	- Do what MemSQL does, except in an open source way.

Know what the data structures use + the how the memory works.

Start small, build up on it later.

We will have access to the git repository.

Goals:
	- Be able to one basic benchmark.
	- Move on to the git repo.
	- Performance improvement over a regular database.
	- 8-10 page report (not just features, more like academic workshop - what is new and interesting about this).
	- By Nov 16th, some source code in the repo. As well as a plan for the design of the database. 
		- Half page on problem statement, a page on related work.
	- Similar to MemSQL, setting for ACID vs performace.	
	
- We should create our own schedule / milestones. 
- Use Tervel.
- We will get a document for scheduling time for using the server.
- ANSI
- Follow Google C++ styleguide.
- C++ 14 can be used.
- Make tools as we need them
- READ THE PAPER
